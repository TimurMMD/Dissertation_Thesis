# Predicting Long-Term Stock Returns: A Machine Learning Approach

This repository contains all the essential files and notebooks used in my research project on predicting long-term stock returns using machine learning (ML) and neural networks (NN). The goal of the project is to develop predictive models that can guide investment strategies, backed by financial and technical indicators.
